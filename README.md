# Partners in Care

The [Partners in Care program](https://www.nashville.gov/departments/police/executive-services/alternative-policing-strategies/partners-care) is a collaboration between the Metro Nashville Police Department, Mental Health Cooperative, and other metro government agencies in order to better serve individuals in the community who are experiencing a behavioral health crisis. The Partners in Care program strives to improve access to care for individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis, divert consumers from the criminal justice system and into the health care system, all while improving the communication and coordination across all systems of care, and increasing the safety of all involved in these crisis interactions. Currently, the Partners in Care program is in the pilot phase, operating only in the areas patrolled by the Hermitage and North Precincts.
